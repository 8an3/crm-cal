If anything changes I can just text him whatever the details are, like an ownership, and he will quote/write it up immediately. He handles all of his customers like this and his rates are the best too. I switched to him because my company dropped me due to my zx-10rr, ever since switching it hasn't cost me more than $950. I've switched everything to him because of his rates, every person that calls him.... switches seriously. Office 905-364-4007 cell 289-380-3824 david.bodnar@thebig.ca. For the person reading this don't take this as a plug. But whatever market your in, get a guy for these types of overcomes. If you live in Ontario, you now have one. I've been working with David for years. He has helped me and I have helped him. It's been a great relationship. If you don't live in Ontario try to find someone like him. He took the approach of selling motorcycle insurance for no profit... at the time of writing this. A lot of agents wish they had someone like me. I opened a city up to him that he didn't have access to. He was so successful in my city that I would hear about him from other people that I had never met. I was his first client in the city, this is a common objection so i pushed him hard on my clients because he helped me so much with my insurance.",

While I'm more than happy to assist you ${firstName} whenever you decide, I wanted to ensure you're aware of the incredible promotions currently available. Our used bikes are now priced at what we paid for them on trade, presenting an unbeatable opportunity for savvy buyers. For new bikes, we're offering promotional rates as low as 1.99%, coupled with generous discounts. These rates are so remarkable that I don't foresee them being this low until next winter. If you choose to wait until after Christmas, I'll be ready to assist you. However, given the exceptional nature of these deals, waiting might mean missing out on substantial savings.  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss these promotions further. Looking forward to helping you make the best decision for your bike purchase! If I don't see or talk to you again before the Holidays, Merry Christmas ${firstName}.",

        body: `We wouldn't sell it for that amount, whatever we take it in on trade, we ad 15%. That way there's really only aa 2% difference between what ur getting after the tax savings and what we sell it for. Any dealer that over prices their inventory, is putting a lot more risk on them selves. Almost all dealers rely on a line of credit in order to have bikes on their floor so any inventory that just sits, is eating away at their profit. The blue book takes the statistical data from the license bureau and bases the values off of what they sell privately and theres enough data to support the pricing. When their isn't, their is some math invloved where you can compare it to previous or ealier model years and get the value that way. Any dealer that sells or takes in on trade above the blue book is gambling at that point and they shouldnt be taking that risk. Like I have the perfect example, I have a road glide here in our used inventory, the last sales manager over paid for it by such a huge amount we almost can't even sell it and we will have to end up loosing thousands on it. Top clean for your bike is 7500 but as I said I can go above it up to $500 more but that would be the limit because any more than that and then the bike will be competing with bikes that are newer. I have to see your bike before I can confirm the increase, I trust what you say about your bike, I just have to confirm it. I'm always very transparent because in the end you will know what we will sell your bike for becuse you can just see it online when we post it anyways. The blue book says to sell your bike for 9100 so that what we would sell it for, unless we gave you the increase then we would sell it for 500 more.`,

Due to the rising costs of the pandemic there will be a new fee on sea-doo as they have introduced to every other line up so far. I don't know what that cost will be for the new fee but it will be called a commodity fee set by brp so the dealers will have to pay for it which means so will the customer.  MSRP's will also be rising and our cost has gone up so the discounts will be smaller. I was talking to an old retired dealer owner who had brp, he was like I don't know how you guys do it, its smaller margins and costs just keep going up and the dealers cant seem to keep people. I'm not saying don't go because you never know when a dealer owner needs to pay his staff or his bills so he doesn't loose his location, but the days of cost units for sale are done. Here on out any consumer buying something at cost will be hurting that dealer horribly and it will be one step closer to shutting its doors. I wish this wasn't the case because I'm a consumer as well but ive been in 2 dealers my whole life and ive seen doors close over and over again, there's almost no more mom and pop shops in canada and they all closed in the last 5 years. It happened with cars, you have huge car groups behind the car dealers with almost no soul but own everything. Sales people come and go more than you clear the snow off youre driveway and you don't have that trusted sales person who you will beleive what they say because they have been doing it forever. I drive my brands and sell what I beleive in, you can't find that in a lot of dealers. When was the last time you bought a ford or ram truck and that sales person loved it so much he bought it with his own money.
